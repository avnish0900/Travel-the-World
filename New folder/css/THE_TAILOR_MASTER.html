                    <p class="text-gray">A suit is a set of men's or women's clothes comprising a suit jacket, or coat, and trousers. When of identical textile, and worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes, it was traditionally considered informal wear in Western dress codes. <br><br>Suits are offered in different designs and constructions. Cut, and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories. A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers, a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat (known as a vest in North America).</p>

                    <p class="text-gray">It’s festival time, and celebrations in India are incomplete without a festive outfit. The ideal attire for men this season is the classic kurta pyjama — it’s elegant, chic and suits every age. The first impression is the last impression, so this season let your fashionable kurta pyjama be your means of self-expression. Here are some tips and tricks from Ravi Gupta, owner, Gargee Designer’s to make your regular kurta pyjama look a bit more stylish.
                        <br> Make your kurta pyjama look interesting by adding a jacket or drape. If your kurta pyjama is in a solid colour, wear a printed or embellished jacket that will give your attire an edge and help highlight the detailing too.

                    <p class="text-gray">Between the notched lapels and the precise tailoring, a blazer might seem like a strictly pro-level project. But sewing a structured jacket isn’t nearly as tricky as you might think. In fact, most of the skills required are ones you have likely tried — and nailed! — in other sewing projects. <br> And just like any new sewing challenge, mastering a blazer comes down to patience and practice.

                        <br> And we’re here to help! These simple tips and hacks will make your first foray into blazers as seamless and stress-free as possible. Read on …  <br>

                    <h2 class="lg-heading text-black">Shirt</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray">A dress shirt, button shirt, button-front, button-front shirt, or button-up shirt is a garment with a collar and a full-length opening at the front, which is fastened using buttons or shirt studs. A button-down or button-down shirt is a dress shirt which has a button-down collar – a collar having the ends fastened to the shirt with buttons. <br>

                        A dress shirt is normally made from woven cloth, and is often accompanied by a tie, jacket, suit, or formalwear, but a dress shirt may also be worn more casually. <br>
                        
                        In British English, "dress shirt" ("formal shirt" or "tuxedo shirt" in American English). <br> </p>

                    <p class="text-gray">A waistcoat has a full vertical opening in the front, which fastens with buttons or snaps. Both single-breasted and double-breasted waistcoats exist, regardless of the formality of dress, but single-breasted ones are more common. In a three piece suit, the cloth used matches the jacket and trousers. Waistcoats can also have lapels or revers depending on the style.

                        Before wristwatches became popular, gentlemen kept their pocket watches in the front waistcoat pocket, with the watch on a watch chain threaded through a buttonhole. Sometimes an extra hole was made in line with the pockets for this use. A bar on the end of the chain held it in place to catch the chain if it were dropped or pulled.</p>

                    <h2>Profession</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray">Sewing is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using stitches made with a needle and thread. Sewing is one of the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era. Before the invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric, archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia sewed fur and skin clothing using bone, antler or ivory needles and "thread" made of various animal body parts including sinew, catgut, and veins. <br> <br>

                        For thousands of years, all sewing was done by hand. The invention of the sewing machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world. <br> Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality tailoring.</p>
